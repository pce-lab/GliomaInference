## Summary
This repository contains an image-based predictive model of tumor growth with application to a murine pre-clinical model of gliomabastoma (GMB). The model is calibrated with the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data of the brain, and predicts the tumor evolution in the future time point. The prediction capability is validated by an example with synthetic tumor model. The proposed model also accounts for uncertainty in the morphology, invasiveness, and spatial and temporal heterogeneity of growing tumors. 

## Key Features

* 2D and 3D simulations
* Perform computational prediction of the tumor evolution
* Uncertainties quantifications 


## Credits
This software uses the following open source packages:

`FEniCS` is a popular open-source computing platform for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). `FEniCS` enables users to quickly translate scientific models into efficient finite element code. With the high-level Python and C++ interfaces to `FEniCS`, it is easy to get started, but `FEniCS` offers also powerful capabilities for more experienced programmers. `FEniCS` runs on a multitude of platforms ranging from laptops to high-performance clusters.

`hIPPYlib` implements state-of-the-art scalable algorithms for
deterministic and Bayesian inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs).
It builds on `FEniCS` for the discretization of the PDE
and on `PETSc` for scalable and efficient linear
algebra operations and solvers.
